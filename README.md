# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

## Overview:

This project focuses on developing a model capable of accurately recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content. The primary aim is to empower users to track their dietary intake, make informed food choices, and maintain a record of their calorie consumption.

## Kaggle Dataset:

The dataset used for training and testing the model can be obtained from Kaggle. Ensure the dataset includes a diverse set of food images with corresponding labels and calorie information. Dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101



## Model Used:

The model architecture and specifics will depend on the nature of the dataset and the complexity of the recognition and estimation task. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image recognition tasks, and the model may incorporate regression components for estimating calorie content.
